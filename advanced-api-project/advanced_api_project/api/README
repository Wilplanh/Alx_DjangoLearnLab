# Book API Endpoints

## Views
- **ListView (GET /books/)** → Retrieve all books (public).
- **DetailView (GET /books/<id>/)** → Retrieve a single book by ID (public).
- **CreateView (POST /books/create/)** → Add a new book (authenticated users).
- **UpdateView (PUT/PATCH /books/<id>/update/)** → Modify an existing book (authenticated users).
- **DeleteView (DELETE /books/<id>/delete/)** → Remove a book (authenticated users).

## Permissions
- Unauthenticated users → read-only access (list, detail).
- Authenticated users → can create, update, and delete.
- Optional: Use `IsAdminOrReadOnly` for stricter control.

## Customizations
- `perform_create`: attaches logged-in user to book.
- `perform_update`: records updater.
- `get_queryset`: allows filtering books by author using query params.

## Testing
Use Postman, curl, or DRF’s browsable API to test all endpoints.
